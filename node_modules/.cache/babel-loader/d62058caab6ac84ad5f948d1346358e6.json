I wanted to explore what the interaction would look like when asking players on online browser-based games to collaborate with me to create graphic form.\n//   I played the games Warmerise and Minetest (a free version of Minecraft). In Warmerise, a first-person shooting game I used the chat function to convince other players to not kill me and to shoot letters on the walls. I ended up with an alphabet of letters that has a thicker bottom and thinner top, due to the bullet holes being bigger close to the player and smaller as they were aiming further away.\n//   In Minetest I joined a server and found players that were interested in helping me to build forms. I then took screenshots of some of the forms and letterforms and made an alphabet of it.\n//   For me, the most important part of this project is not the final alphabet but the conversations I had with the other players. If you browse the website attached to the right you can find some of the conversations I had.

I wanted to explore what the interaction would look like when asking players on online browser-based games to collaborate with me to create graphic form.\n\n  //   I played the games Warmerise and Minetest (a free version of Minecraft). In Warmerise, a first-person shooting game I used the chat function to convince other players to not kill me and to shoot letters on the walls. I ended up with an alphabet of letters that has a thicker bottom and thinner top, due to the bullet holes being bigger close to the player and smaller as they were aiming further away.\n\n  //   In Minetest I joined a server and found players that were interested in helping me to build forms. I then took screenshots of some of the forms and letterforms and made an alphabet of it.\n\n  //   For me, the most important part of this project is not the final alphabet but the conversations I had with the other players. If you browse the website attached to the right you can find some of the conversations I had. Sometimes I had to use Google translate while playing.`\n  // },\n  // {\n  //   id: \"harvard\",\n  //   titleClass: \"projectTitle\",\n  //   name: \"*Harvard Art Museums\",\n  //   year: 2018,\n  //   video: [],\n  //   image: [h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, h7, h8, h9, h10],\n\n  //   technologies: \"Exhibition Design\",\n  //   description: `3D-Warehouse is an amazing website where you can download all sorts of 3D model and import them directly in the free 3D-modelling software Sketchup.
