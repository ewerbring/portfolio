I wanted to explore what the interaction would look like when asking players on online browser-based games to collaborate with me to create graphic form.\n  //   I played the games Warmerise and Minetest (a free version of Minecraft). In Warmerise, a first-person shooting game I used the chat function to convince other players to not kill me and to shoot letters on the walls. I ended up with an alphabet of letters that has a thicker bottom and thinner top, due to the bullet holes being bigger close to the player and smaller as they were aiming further away.\n  //   In Minetest I joined a server and found players that were interested in helping me to build forms. I then took screenshots of some of the forms and letterforms and made an alphabet of it.\n  //   For me, the most important part of this project is not the final alphabet but the conversations I had with the other players. If you browse the website attached to the right you can find some of the conversations I had. Sometimes I had to use Google translate while playing.`\n  //

In Warmerise, a first-person shooting game I used the chat function to convince other players to not kill me and to shoot letters on the walls.
