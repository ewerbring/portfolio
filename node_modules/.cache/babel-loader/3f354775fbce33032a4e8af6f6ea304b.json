I wanted to explore what the interaction would look like when asking players on online browser-based games to collaborate with me to create graphic form.\n  //   I played the games Warmerise and Minetest (a free version of Minecraft). In Warmerise, a first-person shooting game I used the chat function to convince other players to not kill me and to shoot letters on the walls. I ended up with an alphabet of letters that has a thicker bottom and thinner top, due to the bullet holes being bigger close to the player and smaller as they were aiming further away.\n  //   In Minetest I joined a server and found players that were interested in helping me to build forms. I then took screenshots of some of the forms and letterforms and made an alphabet of it.\n  //   For me, the most important part of this project is not the final alphabet but the conversations I had with the other players. If you browse the website attached to the right you can find some of the conversations I had. Sometimes I had to use Google translate while playing.`\n  //

The initial intention was to make an infographic about the subject. I soon realised it is very complicated, so it ended up beeing a catalog of my attempts to understand what it actually is. I interviewed Cem Eskinazi, who is an alumni of this program. I then made a website where where our conversation is presented\n\n  The user is encouraged to click through the interview. In some places, when our conversation is going off on a sidetrack, there are links to the things we are talking about. If the user looks carefully and reads the interview, they can find pockets of information. \n  \n  Here we are talking about rock paper and scissor. Rock beats scissor, scissor beats paper, and paper beats rock again. This is a passion project of one guy extending that to 101 versions. \n  \n  If they find their way to the end of the website it loops again, but with a few new layers on top of it. In the background one of the strangest loop we have is showed, our ecosystem.\n  \n  I think this way of unpacking information, serving it with friction, builds relation to the content. `\n  },\n\n  {\n    type: \"video\",\n\n    filter: \"deepdive\",\n    id: \"sketchup\",\n    titleClass: \"projectTitle\",\n    ingress: \"\",\n    link: \"https://www.blink.se/work/stadium.html\",\n    linkName: \"Look at the Sketchup Model\",\n    name: \"*Sketchhup Explorations\",\n    year: 2019,\n    video: [SketchupVid],\n\n    // video: \"https://player.vimeo.com/video/364928543\",\n    counter: 0,\n    image: [Grim1, Grim2],\n    imageM: [{ original: Sketchup1 }],\n\n    technologies: \"Sketchup\",\n    description: `3D-Warehouse is an amazing website where you can download all sorts of 3D model and import them directly in the free 3D-modelling software Sketchup.

I wanted to explore what the interaction would look like when asking players on online browser-based games to collaborate with me to create graphic form.\n\n  //   I played the games Warmerise and Minetest (a free version of Minecraft). In Warmerise, a first-person shooting game I used the chat function to convince other players to not kill me and to shoot letters on the walls. I ended up with an alphabet of letters that has a thicker bottom and thinner top, due to the bullet holes being bigger close to the player and smaller as they were aiming further away.\n\n  //   In Minetest I joined a server and found players that were interested in helping me to build forms. I then took screenshots of some of the forms and letterforms and made an alphabet of it.\n\n  //   For me, the most important part of this project is not the final alphabet but the conversations I had with the other players. If you browse the website attached to the right you can find some of the conversations I had. Sometimes I had to use Google translate while playing.`\n  // },\n];\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
