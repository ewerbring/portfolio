I interviewed Cem Eskinazi, who is an alumni of this program. I then made a website where where our conversation is presented\n\n  The user is encouraged to click through the interview. In some places, when our conversation is going off on a sidetrack, there are links to the things we are talking about. If the user looks carefully and reads the interview, they can find pockets of information. \n  \n  Here we are talking about rock paper and scissor. Rock beats scissor, scissor beats paper, and paper beats rock again. This is a passion project of one guy extending that to 101 versions. \n  \n  If they find their way to the end of the website it loops again, but with a few new layers on top of it. In the background one of the strangest loop we have is showed, our ecosystem.\n  \n  I think this way of unpacking information, serving it with friction, builds relation to the content. `\n  },\n  {\n    id: \"sketchup\",\n    titleClass: \"projectTitle\",\n    name: \"*Sketchhup Explorations\",\n    year: 2019,\n    video:\n      \"https://player.vimeo.com/video/364930588?autoplay=1&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\",\n    counter: 0,\n    image: [Grim1, Grim2],\n\n    technologies: \"Sketchup\",\n    description: `3D-Warehouse is an amazing website where you can download all sorts of 3D model and import them directly in the free 3D-modelling software Sketchup.
