          I have come to realise I tend to make things that forces the user to
          engage. Either with me, with others or with an interface. This has

          good to implement friction. If we have to think a little, I think we

          asking a professor for help in an assignment. Would you want them to

          you in the right direction, give you some small breadcrumbs and let
          you figure out the answer yourself?
