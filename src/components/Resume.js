    description: `Grimeton Radio Station (Radiostation in swedish) is located outside Varberg on the Swedish west coast. It was very important for Scandinavia during world war II. The long wave radio transmitter was during periods the only ways for Scandinavia to communicate with the US.
    It was added to the Unesco World Heritage List in 2004, with the statement: "Grimeton Radio Station, Varberg is an outstanding monument representing the process of development of communication technology in the period following the First World War."
    In a school assignment, I combined a text about the daily life at Grimeton Radio Station with a general text about Unesco and the mission to preserve important sites around the world.`
